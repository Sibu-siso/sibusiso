<p>As earlier mentioned, I am currently attending my secondary education at St. Mary's Secondary School. Before that, I attended my primary school at Don Gordon, Chinese International School and finally Sonshine School. I am particularly fascinated in Korean music and dramas as well as their cuisines. In my free time, I enjoy learning Spanish and Korean, reading romance novels, baking and watching videos on YouTube. In grade 7 & 9, I excelled with flying colours in my national examinations and I am hoping to do the same in the twelfth grade.
